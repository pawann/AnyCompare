/**
 Usecases
**/

1) User passes actual and expected objects to the API. API returns true if all the fields in both of the objects are identical, false otherwise.

2) User registers a Difference-listener (Some implementations could be provided out of the box eg LogDiffListener). 
   For each difference this listener is called.
   User calls the API with actual and expected objects. API returns true/false considering the listener execution.

3) User should be able to retrieve list of differences (i. compare api returns a collection of diffs, or a separate call to context?)
